      <description>Building backend systems today will likely involve building many small, independent services that communicate and coordinate with one another to form a distributed system. While there are many resources available discussing the pros and cons of microservices, the architecture, and when it is appropriate to use, I want to focus on the functional testing of microservices and how it differs from traditional approaches.
In my experience, the &amp;ldquo;best testing practices&amp;rdquo; have evolved with the introduction of microservices, and traditional testing pyramids may not be the most effective or even potentially harmful in this context.</description>
